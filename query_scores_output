Estimates of self-assessed personality for each file, using standardized features:

File              	Extra	Emoti	Agree	Consc	Openn
query.txt        	4.782	3.967	4.644	4.768	4.681


Extra = Extraversion
Emoti = Emotional stability
Agree = Agreeableness
Consc = Conscientiousness
Openn = Openness to experience

Models are trained to output scores on a scale from 1 (low) to 7 (high),
the scores might need to be normalized depending on the application domain.

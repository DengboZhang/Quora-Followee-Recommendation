Why isnt b9 an available tension for a C7 chord in the key of C?I understand that it isnt available because b9 isnt diatonic to the key of C major  However, what baffled me more was what I found when I was researching this topic The explanation that Joe Mulholland gives is:If you put b9 on the V7 of IV chord, the implication to the listener is that a IV minor chord is coming instead  Itâ€™s because that tension, the b9 on the dominant chord, mimics the sound of V7(b9) in the minor key I tried all permutations and combinations as to which b9 and which V7(b9) he is referring to and for all I was worth, I couldnt make head or tail of his comment there  Can someone be kind enough to elucidate this comment?Link to the comment: Thanks in advance!
